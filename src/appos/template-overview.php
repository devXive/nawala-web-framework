	<p>The Nawala!RDK is a sophisticated framework with the sole intention of being the best platform to build solid web apps with.
	    Nawala takes all the lessons learned during the development of many XiveApp's and XiveTheme's and distills that knowledge
	    into a single super-flexible environment that is easy to configure, simple to extend, and powerful enough to handle anything
	    we want to throw at it.</p>
